              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For young producers, the road to reaching that special point in space-time where you are confident with your finished product and would like to share your sonic creation with the world is paved with a lot of confusion in finding that finished, polished sound, let alone a sound that is yours, and typically initialized by some sort of feeling or impact that another musician's work had on you prior to your throwing down of the gauntlet. There is so much to learn and so much time devoted to tweaking parameters on devices well outside the parlance of the common tongue that the emotional investment, whose interest accrues with the passing of each session in the studio, can often cloud the mind of the producer and render their realist faculties a bit stunted. In all fairness, this is probably how it should be—even Kant spoke of the importance of a world of ends as opposed to a world of means; however, the end of your first creative process that truly contributes to the airwaves often places you, the producer, in a situation that is almost as nebulous as your initial encounters with electronic music production itself. Do you submit your work to record labels? Do you try to get gigs? Do you promote your music? Unless the proverbial “next step” was outlined for you, in detail, when you began producing, this particular vista can prove as muddy as your low-end before you learned what an equalizer was and how to use it. There are more ways to go with your music than there are fish in the sea.<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a comprehensive list of options would be both exhausting to compile and fail to ultimately take into account the situational details of each producer, what follows is an examination of a typical, base-passive revenue stream for independent musicians and how this revenue stream fits in to full-time, occupational viability.<br /><br />

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I would like my music to support me financially.”<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, “music is math;” let's do some! These numbers can be substituted and played with to suit your liking; however, we're going to start with the magic number that is $2,000.00 of monthly income. This number will be used both to represent a moderate, base income but also to put the following aspects of “branding” into a more digestible perspective.<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let's sell some music!”<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that you are a fan of selling digital copies of your tracks for download, we have our first, obvious revenue stream. While the typical rate for tracks is around $0.99, this number can vary from vendor to vendor and from genre to genre. In the world of psychedelic trance for instance, tracks are typically sold for $2.49. Incorporating the benefit of the doubt, we will use the latter as the amount for our calculations. The takeaway? You would need 804 downloads, per month, to sustain your monthly income.<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting that aside for a moment, this particular aspect of your revenue stream is rather unique amongst the traditional options as it remains both intrinsically malleable and also highly debated in the music community—typically with regard to relevancy and effectiveness. Let's say, for instance, that your first release is a ten track album. Let's also say that each one of your fans, regardless of where they come from or how you got them, as we have yet to discuss promotion, commits to the purchase of the entirety of your album. You now only need 81 fans in order to reach your monthly income goal. What this really means though, because we are talking about selling digital copies of your tracks, is that you need not only 81 fans the month of your release, but a minimum 81 new fans every month thereafter—again who commit to the purchase of the entirety of the album. The reason for this is that fans who purchase digital copies rarely, if ever, purchase the same copy again—they “own” the tracks they purchase. Incidentally, this situation can contribute to one of the reasons why you might choose not to sell your tracks in such a fashion—but that topic gets more into exposure and promotion and deviates from the scope of this article).<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus represents the landscape of receiving compensation for your sale of your music through the medium of digital downloads. In the spirit of our mathematical journey however, let us assume that each fan purchases only one track and not the rather ambitious totality of the project—in such a fashion, the ratio of fans to purchases becomes 1:1. The number of fans needed per month then goes back to 804.<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What about streaming?”<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the almighty Google, artists are typically paid around $0.006 per stream on Spotify. This particular figure appears to serve as the minimum amount; however, it's cousin, the maximum, is found not too far off. So how many streams are required for your monthly income? 333,334—again, per month. As a new producer, a great way to get a feel for the magnitude of that number is to take a look at your preferred hosting provider, typically Soundcloud, and find the “plays in total” section under your statistics. Reference that number with the time it took to create your album, taking into consideration the shares you made along the way and the shares you have made since your project's release, and you should begin to have a good understanding of how your project fits into the world of compensation and Spotify. It is important to keep in mind that if you connect your music to multiple streaming services you will have more exposure; however, the number above would more than likely remain the benchmark for your monthly income target. (This omits any initial investment required to host your music on streaming services such as the cost to release on CDBaby or Tunecore for instance).<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we have two numbers that we can work with. Let's try to fit them together and make some sense out of our revenue options.<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're going to introduce a word that may be familiar to some: impressions. This term is used quite a bit in the world of online advertising and simply refers to individual engagements with your content. In this example, we have two types of impressions: digital download purchases and streams. Impressions, alone, are just a number. They serve to quantify certain activities. Speaking from a rather strict point of view, the only real information an impression count can give you is raw popularity. Combined with other tools, impressions are a great for gaining perspective into your brand's relationship to its consumers—in this case: your music and the masses—because they help identify that point where somebody takes time out of their busy, data-drowned lives, and engages with what you have to offer. This quickly escalates into conversion rates and promotion however and will not be discussed in this article.<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, simple weighted average, you need at least 1,604 impressions per month to meet your monthly income goal. This number is actually rather volatile as, in reality, the distribution could vary greatly from month to month; however, it serves our purposes just fine for the time being. To get a rough idea of what this number signifies, provided you have a Facebook page, you can scan your posts and compare the reach of your posts to the number of interactions that post helps create—taking into account that the vast majority of the posts on your page are more than likely not directed to either your digital downloads or your streams. When it comes to impressions related directly to your revenue, perhaps you can begin to gauge this number a bit better. The logical question that follows? How can we reduce this number?<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“T-shirt junkies of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but five minutes of your time!”<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merchandising serves as the final core element of the Indie musician's revenue arsenal. With the magic of the internet, it has never been easier to not only acquire the merchandise that you would like but also to do so in a fashion that barely touches your banking account—if it touches your account at all. There are so many great ways to host merchandising alongside your music that I will skip the setting and background and cut to the chase: let's say you make $10.00 per t-shirt sale. (This number will vary as well but is both doable and generous—perfect for our examination). So how many impressions are needed with the addition of our first t-shirt? 481.<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We got the number down rather significantly but let's remember that this is per month. With some basic diversification of revenue streams, we can see how, in theory, we need fewer impressions per month to reach our goal. The rule of thumb? The higher the profit margin, the lower the necessary impression count.<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice to say that, with a single album, streaming support, and a moderate store of, say, five items, your minimum impression count required to achieve your $2,000.00 monthly income goal would be somewhere between 250 and 300—depending on the specific profit margins. Keeping in mind that downloads are typically downloaded once, merchandise is typically purchased once, and that the number of streams required to see any significant return is quite high, it is fairly safe to say that your actual impression count is, again, fairly unique and per month—meaning acquisition. It is also important to note that with such wide ranges for the impression-to-revenue ratios, this minimum impression count, while important in forming a baseline of understanding with regard to your base-passive revenue, can be quite misleading if not understood correctly.<br /><br />

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This has all been very interesting but what does it mean? TL;DR”<br /><br />

            	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this essentially boils down to the notion that the level of income required from strictly passive revenue sources to support a monthly income of $2,000.00 is far more indicative of a well-established artist than it is of any new producer entering the scene. As this examination provides a pretty concrete understanding of base-passive revenue as it relates to monthly income, young producers can reference this framework to secure a baseline from which to structure their income-generating activities—whether that be creating novel ways to generate passive revenue or taking on a much more active role in the propagation of their brand (gigging, etc).<br /><br />
