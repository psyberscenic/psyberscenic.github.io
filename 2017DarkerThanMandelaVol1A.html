              &emsp;So this set is titled “Darker than Mandela”...I have a dark sense of humor...Remember! It's what's on the inside that counts...<br /><br />


              &emsp;Although...sometimes it's not. I'm not sure if you've ever heard of Snapchat, or what most people do with their time that are my age, but I can guarantee you that these words have never entered their sphere of influence: ONE: metacognition, TWO: existential dread, or THREE: “Hey! You would love this author Sylvia Plath!"<br /><br />

              &emsp;It's surreal. I'm convinced that most people my age have never once questioned existence or this ridiculous thing we call life OR have ever experienced the deep personal pain that comes with that.<br /><br />


              &emsp;Which is a HUGE problem for me as a white male. Because, you know, that's how I should probably fill out my form at the DMV. Organ donor...I got you...<br /><br />


              &emsp;Honestly, if I did kill myself driving....I would just hope that one of my organs wound up in a really gorgeous college girl. Not high school, not post-grad, college. Like...Georgia Tech. Right when she's figuring out who she wants to be and what she wants to do. Then!...my lingering essence in the physical world would call to me in Hades and I would rise up! Rise up and fill this girl with raging sexual energy—help her take shit from no one. Get her that job, get her that promotion, get her the fucking presidency. Help her change the world and make it a better place for not just women, but everybody inhabiting the planet. That's what being an organ donor is all about.<br /><br />


              &emsp;Girls, man...So I play the guitar...But I never understood people's fascination with playing the guitar and getting girls. First of all, if you write alternative rock songs on acoustic, or electric for that matter, you don't really play the guitar, or even enjoy the concept of a challenging creative venture for that matter. Second of all, I'm not left handed...so obviously my left hand helps me very little in the direct act of fingering. It doesn't work. And since I play electric with a pick...the right hand doesn't help me much either. It would be a chaotic orgasm at best. That girl would be so extremely disheartened that she went home with me...BUT...she would have butterflies in her vagina for the rest of the weekend. Now flamenco...Ah ha....we head a little to the east and things are starting to make a little more sense.<br /><br />


              &emsp;Spain's definitely got a thing or two understood about sex. You gotta give 'em that. Germany though. You know prostitution is legal there? It's not just legal, it's unionized. So imagine your “crazy” high school friend Crystal giving a press conference on public television on how incredibly complicated and frustrating these wage negotiations are. But you know...”If you got the money honey, we got your disease...” In all seriousness though, I want to go. Fuck sight-seeing, fuck beaches, fuck cruise ships, fuck Snapchat...I grew up moving around overseas my whole life so I've done all that. I just want 15,000 dollars and two weeks in Berlin. Call it one last hurrah before I'm off to the Middle East to start a new life and plot the explosively disruptive demise of Snapchat.<br /><br />


              &emsp;It's just that...Tel Aviv has such a good climate for startups...<br /><br />


              &emsp;If only they could figure out the Palestinian apartheid problem though...<br /><br />


              &emsp;OK...That might be unfair of me. I mean, they're a Jewish state surrounded by people who hate them with their only friend and earthbound, divine protector being the United States of America. Israel is just making the best of shitty situation. I mean, it's not like they asked for it...<br /><br />


              &emsp;I mean, I didn't ask to be raised Catholic...but I was. It's OK though...the Catholic Church seems to have a pretty good grasp on life. The age of reason is 7 years old—the age that a child becomes morally responsible. It's like “ Welcome to reason and participation in the adult community!! By the way...there's this thing called puberty happening in a few years, which should also last a few years, but you'll do great!”<br /><br />


              &emsp;That's like your “crazy” high school friend Crystal going into the wage negotiations without the eternal, undying loyalty and aid of the underworld. It would be chaotic at best...But hey, that's life. Automation is going to slowly take all of our jobs, your college degree is more than likely how much debt you're willing to take on to feel safe and in line, and most people's concept of work is hilarious! The whole point of work is so that you don't have to work anymore by the way. Think Rick and Morty. Honestly, just make three hundred thousand, five hundred dollars and invest in rental real-estate in the Midwest and you're looking down the barrel of sitting on your ass doing nothing, making a passive income of around fifteen hundred dollars a month. Not bad, not bad...<br /><br />


              &emsp;  Oh, I'm sorry, does three hundred and fifty thousand dollars sound like a lot? Work for five years with the right college degree and you'll have it. Or is your degree not working out for you? I know, I know...What if I didn't go to college? Well, welcome to the age of the internet! Ever thought about making an app? Do it! Want to teach people how to do “stuff?” Do it! Want to get so deeply addicted to “Japanese culture” that you go out and protest for your universally funded Viagra? Do it!<br /><br />


              &emsp;Look...I'm not going to make a joke about Nike...or even how much further east we'd have to go to make sense of that whole thing...but I will say the Greek goddess of Victory was wielding the dull broadsword of puberty when she smiled upon me. I love universal healthcare...I have no problem with making an app—considering all the raw materials are out there for free...and I have no problem with working for five years...It's just that three hundred and fifty thousand dollars sounds like a lot of money and a LOT of responsibility.<br /><br />


              &emsp;I guess, in that respect, Crystal has me beat. Hell, I may be her left kidney but she's the one taking on the capitalist pigs and leading her working girls to responsible and fair working conditions.<br /><br />


              &emsp;Competition...what a wonderful thing. “I'll take a hit to my net income in order to keep the overall market more competitive...” said no corporation ever. The whole point of competition is to not compete! The whole point of work is to not work! “The whole point of homework is to get less of it!” Tell all this to a prepubescent boy about to make his first holy communion.<br /><br />


              &emsp;I get it...I get it...Spirituality is a slightly different thing from the material world. After all...spirituality has it's basis in metacognition—conclusions derived from abstract reflection applied to both the internal and external worlds of your being. Maya...The world is illusion...<br /><br />


              &emsp;There is no spoon, the cake is a lie, and there is no self...<br /><br />


              &emsp;I'm serious...Think about it. What is your “self” really? You're obviously more than what you do--your profession for example…because there's other stuff you relate to. You're obviously not just your body, emotions, mind, and spirit--because what connects all those?<br /><br />


              &emsp;Truth be told...you are always defined in relationship to the infinitude of other things in existence. All other things--no matter how small or far away. Your “self” has an ever-changing relationship to Alpha Centauri, for example, just as it has an ever-changing relationship to pasta. Objects and connections...All objects. All connections. All the time. Again…We move a little further to the east and we're starting to get somewhere…But no wonder it has been said that the universe got a little too big for the Buddha from time to time on his quest toward enlightenment. Can you imagine being as far out as Alpha Centauri just chilling under a bodhi tree almost two and a half millennia before the advent of virtual reality? Technology progresses so quickly! Hence, why, at a certain point, you just gotta let go and be. Pure being. Absolutely nothing in your head, etc. Just “turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream. It is not dying. It is being.” Or quite possibly that funny tab of paper your friend gave you about an hour ago somewhere in this oddly vibrant, euphoric, and animated room that I think is in a house somewhere...where we came for a...party...and oh my God...I'm tripping balls...
              <br /><br />

              &emsp;Point is, there are many roads to enlightenment. Just as there are many roads to God. Whether you find God under a bodhi tree or through a small tab of paper your friend gave you earlier, it's all part of your journey. I'm just saying that the only way to relate to everything is to relate to nothing and nothing's not nothing--if you see what I’m saying...<br /><br />


              &emsp;Like universal healthcare, I love spirituality. It's been said that money doesn't buy happiness but it can but a jet ski. I would just posit that spirituality can't buy a jet ski but it can buy peace of mind...and as far as I'm concerned, that's a huge part of happiness.<br /><br />


              &emsp;The problem for some is that spirituality doesn't sell jet skis. So what's a poor boy to do? Go to college? Take on thousands of dollars of debt? Work for ten years before you can afford a down payment on a house? Work another ten before you can afford the down payment on that jet ski? And then work another twenty before you die of heart disease? Or turn on, tune in, and drop out? Like I said...spirituality is a little different from the material world.<br /><br />


              &emsp;Possessions come and go, man. Nothing lasts and we're only ever really borrowing and rearranging things. There is no point because there is no goal and shit is not teleological. The cake is a lie. How can you keep an imaginary goal or destination in your head when you passed ego death years ago and would much rather just sit under this bodhi tree and enjoy the sunshine daydream?<br /><br />


              &emsp;There just is no spoon because the three that you have to your name are always dirty in the sink. Just wash them after you use them! Trix for life…<br /><br />


              &emsp;So where are we? Siddhartha Gautama? India?<br /><br />


              &emsp;India and fucking sweatshops, man. Perhaps not as bad as Bangladesh but things start to get a little murky when you're comparing investment in this industry. These people are poor. They work unfathomably long hours, in conditions mirroring those of the textile mills in early coal-rape England, and they are paid next to nothing. You probably get irritated if you have to use a vacation day to go see your dentist for a check-up. These people don't know what it's like to work in air conditioning and are lucky if they don't lose all their teeth by the time they hit middle age. All so that you can post your new Nike's on Facebook.<br /><br />


              &emsp;And yet we're infuriated when our jobs are “going overseas.” Look, I don't mean to neglect or bypass an issue, but arguing over jobs and the labor market is about as superfluous as a seven year old Indian seamstress who can read. Indians and Mexicans are just a distraction from what is really taking your job--that sweet, sweet silicon.<br /><br />


              &emsp;In March, the Los Angeles Times wrote an article on how 38% of our jobs will be replaced by machines in the year 2030. So prepubescent Michael is looking at over a one in three chance that, if he makes it through puberty, he won't have a job. Which is unfortunate because Catholics are notorious breeders and children are expensive--let alone the jet ski.<br /><br />


              &emsp;So how do we solve this problem? It's quite easy actually! We just tell people that this is going on! The problem isn't little Gita who reads at a high school level, it's that nobody seems to know this is happening! And moreover, because they don't know this is happening, they're scared of early warning signs like Miguel who can drive Lyft just as well as you can. You may be an American but Miguel, who never bothered working at the factory, can drive that car just as well as anybody--pump the gas, pump the brakes, turn the steering wheel, make an effort to avoid cataclysmic events in his life like losing his job to automation...and he's bilingual! Now, that's what I call driver awareness.<br /><br />


              &emsp;There are too many drivers and too little driver awareness. And the kicker is that that sweet, sweet, mistress, Silicon Sally, is not a vile succubus of fate sent by Zeus to torture poor Michael after his hard fight triumph over Nike..<br /><br />


              &emsp;You mean to tell me that human beings can work fewer hours and lead more leisurely, productive, and peaceful lives? Life's devoted to wonder and beauty and play? Without the constant fighting over who got what job that poor Gita could just do anyway? And considering that there are more smartphones than there are people on the planet right now, I think that it's safe to say that Silicon Sally can smile upon us all. She's like the Santa your parents never told you about because the paper clip that literally walked you through everything in Microsoft word was too confusing.<br /><br />


              &emsp;So, to reiterate...as a society of humans inhabiting planet Earth, we should all take a hint from our neighbor Miguel and have a little driver awareness. Granted, we may not reach such​ heights as alpha centauri but we might be able to get Gita a copy of Little Women and some toothpaste.<br /><br />


              &emsp;Let's take this from a different angle...Do you have any idea how mundane reality is? It's ridiculous. Honestly, based on half your professions, I'm surprised that you didn't just take to the knife before getting in the car to come here with your significant other tonight...Do you have any idea how little brain power it takes to do half your jobs...? And what a processing powerhouse Silicon Sally is? You're a molecular superstructure. A biological abomination before all other species on the planet and yet, for some reason, you're content to settle on that data entry job or write that “new” alternative rock song.<br /><br />


              &emsp;I guarantee you that half the kids in the middle school orchestra down the road can write more intricate songs than that--and do your data entry too if they were so instructed. Kids are very impressionable. The problem is this...in the words of Einstein: “everybody's a genius but if you teach a fish to climb a tree, it will grow up thinking it's stupid it's whole life.” What does this mean? In short, it means “chill out, you're a genius.” But more specifically it means that the genius of the species is not being properly tapped into because education is currently designed to be a one size fits all condom.<br /><br />


              &emsp;In steps Silicon Sally! Who comes not once a year but waits patiently, for you, to call on her...whenever you like! Imagine current K through 12 education being personalized to each and every boy and girl through the magic of their smartphones and over-with in half the time. That means less stress, more time with friends and family, and everything that kids could ever need to pursue their own genius available to them. So goodbye one size fits all condom! Hello 100 milligrams of Viagra and free KY intense! Help me help you propagate your genius.<br /><br />


              &emsp;Some people are not of this opinion, though--and I can understand that. Sometimes I hear others saying that “x amount of people just have to go.” These people would rather eradicate the problem with megatons of explosives or funny-tasting drinking water than just solve it for humanity on the whole. In short, it’s a lazy fix to a problem whose solution offers an immense amount of reward to our species. Still...some would rather just take that route anyways and worry about the consequences later--ah to be young and stupid again.<br /><br />


              &emsp;Where are we? You guessed it! China!<br /><br />


              &emsp;Three words for you: one child policy.<br /><br />


              &emsp;I’ll hold off on this for a second and just drop the four types of resources that most economists can agree exist in the world. Land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Did you catch that? Labor is one of the four types of resources that we as a species possess and can tap into for the betterment of our lives and the growth of the economy. Some economists even go as far as to categorize these resources into two categories: human and non-human. So, sure, give some of the people some funny-tasting drinking water or tell them that they can only have one child, but all you’re doing is taking that production possibilities frontier and kicking it in the balls over and over again--hurting the economy by literally, and figuratively, laying waste to potential offspring. It’s kind of like Michael finding himself in Berlin on a school trip and choosing to masturbate in his hotel room rather than make nice with one of Crystal’s working girls--everybody suffers. I think God might have even shed a tear on that one...
              <br /><br />

              &emsp;The problem I have with China is that I honestly think they had the right idea...they just didn’t take it far enough or in the right direction. So they got a third of the solution right. If only they could apply that to the job market we’d be well on our way...<br /><br />


              &emsp;In all seriousness though, China saw that they simply had too many “alive” people and needed some more “not-alive” people. They didn’t want to contaminate Beijing’s water supply--mostly because it’s already contaminated and that would just make too much sense--so they restricted the future population under the premise that some just had to go.<br /><br />


              &emsp;What does that even mean? You don’t have enough places to put people? Your belligerent child-neighbour to the east built Taipei 101 out of competition...for fun. We don’t have enough food to feed everybody? According to the Huffington Post we do: “We Already Grow Enough Food For 10 Billion People--And Still Can’t End Hunger,” said Mr. Gimenez during the December of 2014. So we clearly have housing and food sorted out...Considering we already have smartphones under wraps, I would say that we’re well on our way to solving this problem of “we have too many ‘alive’ people.”<br /><br />


              &emsp;What gets me the most about this, though, is that it’s China. It’s a near-perfect example of a communist, totalitarian state. The government has so much power and control over the people that, in my mind, if they wanted to get first-place in the race to a society where housing, food, and education are all provided and streamlined, they could--freeing up the genius and gene-pool of their people at the same time and fostering real innovation and progress. They just don’t. I mean, if China isn’t making it...what hope do we have? But, I maintain that at least they saw the problem and did something about it. That shows initiative...they’re willing to tackle the hard problems. We just need them to get the other two thirds of the solution in order and we’ll be fine...maybe in thirteen years or so. So, granted, we may be a ways away from 100 milligrams of Viagra and an unlimited supply of KY intense but we can definitely get there.
              So...again...we head a little to the east and things start to make a little more sense. Not total sense...just a little more than in India where “governments have systematically chosen the cheaper option of mass sterilization of poorly educated women in remote communities over education on birth control and contraceptives,” according to The Guardian. At least in China poor Gita would be fought over by the males of her society, assuming she was allowed to live, instead of leading an essentially barren life from right around the time Michael received his first wafer. Suddenly this new horizon of Viagra and KY intense is looking pretty good.  I’m going to skip tentacle porn and universally funded boner pills to head a bit closer to the sun. Onward to the Galapagos!<br /><br />


              &emsp;Let me just pause for a moment. I realize that I’ve been saying the word “species” a lot in this set and I know that, in some circles, this can get people a bit riled up. Just ask Crystal’s grandfather. Or...we could, had he made the cut.<br /><br />


              &emsp;I also realize that this may be getting a little dark for some; so, I will just remind you of three things: firstly, your shadow can be terrifying--I understand that; secondly, when I was writing this bit, I was wrestling with my own shadow and, I kid you not, a squirrel just came up super close to me, checked me out, and walked on by--so there is definitely something to be said about cosmic love throughout the journey of the soul; finally, I will just remind you of the temperature that book paper catches on fire, in the event that this set ever gets adapted into a book, it’s 451 degrees--let's just keep that in mind as we progress.<br /><br />
